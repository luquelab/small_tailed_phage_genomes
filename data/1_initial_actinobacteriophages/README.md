This folder contains the initial data shared from Simon White about small tailed actinobacteriophages.

This is the original message from Simon White (2021-05-14)
"Attached the small phage measurements I did ages ago.
These are all phage that are in the actinobacteriophage database and are in the archive so we can actually get CryoEM of them.
Plan is to pick 15 of these (two from each cluster).
I didnâ€™t finish the cluster column."

Use this list as a training set. Then check the Actinobacteria database with a concrete criteria to filter/add candidates for the initial project release.
